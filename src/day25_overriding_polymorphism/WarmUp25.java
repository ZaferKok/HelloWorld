1-a) Reusability b) Maintenance				//to minimize the amount of duplicate code 
2-Public class Child extends Parents {} 	//we use extends keyword to inherit it
3-protected and public ones. default and private ones cannot.
4-super() is used to call the constructors from the parent class, this() is used to call the constructors from the same class
5-super() is used to call the constructors, super. is used to call parent class variables and methods
6-this() is used to call the constructors in class, this. is used to call in class variables and methods
7-super. is used to call variables and methods from the parent class, this. is used to call variables and methods from the same class
you can call parent class variables and method with "this" but not recommended. it can cause problem.
8-True
